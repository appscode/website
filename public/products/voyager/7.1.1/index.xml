Operator version: Voyager does not follow semver, rather the major version of operator points to the Kubernetes client-go version. You can verify this from the glide.yaml file. This means there might be breaking changes between point releases of the operator. This generally manifests as changed annotation keys or their meaning. Please always check the release notes for upgrade instructions. CRD version: appscode.</description></item><item><title>Support | Voyager</title><link>https://appscode.com/products/voyager/7.1.1/welcome/support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://appscode.com/products/voyager/7.1.1/welcome/support/</guid><description>New to Voyager?
