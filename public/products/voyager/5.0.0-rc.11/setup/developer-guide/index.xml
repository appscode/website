If you find a requirement that this doc does not capture, please submit an issue on github.
This document is intended to be relative to the branch in which it is found. It is guaranteed that requirements will change over time for the development branch, but release branches of Voyager should not change.</description></item><item><title>Release | Voyager</title><link>https://appscode.com/products/voyager/5.0.0-rc.11/setup/developer-guide/release/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://appscode.com/products/voyager/5.0.0-rc.11/setup/developer-guide/release/</guid><description>Release Process The following steps must be done from a Linux x64 bit machine.
Do a global replacement of tags so that docs point to the next release. Push changes to the release-x branch and apply new tag. Push all the changes to remote repo. Build and push voyager &amp;amp; HAProxy docker images:
$ cd ~/go/src/github.com/appscode/voyager ./hack/release.sh Now, update the release notes in Github. See previous release notes to get an idea what to include there.</description></item></channel></rss>
