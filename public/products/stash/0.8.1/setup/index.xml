      <description>Upgrading Stash If you are upgrading Stash to a patch release, please reapply the installation instructions. That will upgrade the operator pod to the new version and fix any RBAC issues.
Upgrading from 0.6.x to 0.7.x If you are installing via scripts, then uninstall the old version first and then reinstall the new version. If you are using Helm, follow the instructions from setup section.
Upgrading from 0.5.x to 0.</description>
