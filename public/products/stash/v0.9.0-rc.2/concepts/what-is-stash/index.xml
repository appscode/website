At the heart of Stash, it is a Kubernetes controller. It uses Custom Resource Definition(CRD) to specify targets and behaviors of backup and restore process in a Kubernetes native way. A simplified architecture of Stash is shown below:
Fig: Stash Architecture Components Stash consists of various components that implement backup and restore logic. This section will give you a brief overview of such components.</description></item><item><title>Stash Overview</title><link>https://appscode.com/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.2/concepts/what-is-stash/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://appscode.com/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.2/concepts/what-is-stash/overview/</guid><description>Stash Stash by AppsCode is a Kubernetes operator for restic. If you are running production workloads in Kubernetes, you might want to take backup of your disks, databases etc. Traditional tools are too complex to setup and maintain in a dynamic compute environment like Kubernetes. restic is a backup program that is fast, efficient and secure with few moving parts. Stash is a CRD controller for Kubernetes built around restic to address these issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
