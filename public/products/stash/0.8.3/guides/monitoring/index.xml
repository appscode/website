      <description>Monitoring Stash with builtin Prometheus This tutorial will show you how to configure builtin Prometheus scrapper to monitor Stash backup and recovery operations as well as Stash operator.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube.
To keep Prometheus resources isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace to deploy Prometheus server.</description>
