        "description": "Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for container orchestration, transforming the way applications are deployed and managed. While Kubernetes provides a strong foundation, its built-in resources may not always meet the needs of complex use cases. This is where custom resources and controllers come into play. Custom resources enable you to create new resource types that align with your specific requirements, going beyond the standard Kubernetes objects. However, building controllers to manage these custom resources can be a complex task, requiring a deep understanding of Kubernetes internals and state management. This Whitepaper covers:",
