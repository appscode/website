        "description": "Kubernetes has become the backbone of cloud-native development, powering containerized applications and microservices at scale. While Kubernetes provides a robust orchestration platform, many complex scenarios require extending its capabilities beyond the default resources. This is where custom resources and controllers become invaluable. They allow you to tailor Kubernetes to your specific operational needs, but implementing them requires deep expertise in cluster state management and DevOps best practices. This whitepaper covers:",
