      "question": "What does the “Cloud-Native Product Development” service include?",
      "answer": "Our service covers the full lifecycle of building cloud-native products: from opportunity discovery, MVP development, engineering & DevOps, to launch and scaling. We combine disciplined processes, DevOps practices and pragmatic engineering to deliver predictable, high-quality outcomes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which technologies and practices are used in your cloud-native development?",
      "answer": "We leverage Kubernetes orchestration, microservices architecture, continuous delivery pipelines (CI/CD), automated testing, infrastructure as code, observability (monitoring/logging), and hybrid/multi-cloud deployment patterns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work with our existing product roadmap & stack or do we need to start from scratch?",
      "answer": "Yes — we can accommodate both. If you already have a roadmap, architecture or tech stack, our engineers integrate with your teams, refine the design and lift your product into containerised, cloud-native, and production-ready form. If you’re starting fresh, we help shape the roadmap, build the MVP and iterate fast."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the typical timeline and engagement model?",
      "answer": "We typically start with a short discovery phase (1-2 weeks) to align on goals, architecture and MVP scope. Then we move into 4-8 week sprints of development. Engagement models include fixed-scope short engagements, time & materials with our engineers embedded into your team, or longer term resident-architect style support."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We design your product to be cloud-agnostic and ready to deploy on public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premises Kubernetes clusters. Our patterns ensure portability, scalability and operational consistency across environments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure quality, security and reliability in the product you build?",
      "answer": "Quality is built-in via automated testing, code reviews, continuous integration, and observability. Security is baked in through container isolation, role-based access, secrets management and vulnerability scanning. We use production-grade patterns for reliability, monitoring, backup/recovery and disaster resilience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens after we launch the product?",
      "answer": "After launch we help you measure user behaviour, optimise performance, and scale the system. We can take you into a “scale” phase where we tune infrastructure, implement automation and help you deliver on growth while keeping costs under control."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does this service cost and what are the pricing models?",
      "answer": "Cost varies based on scope, complexity, number of teams, cloud integration and ongoing support. We offer model options such as fixed-price MVP builds, hourly/engagement workflows, and retainers for ongoing product engineering and scaling. We’ll provide a detailed proposal after our discovery phase."
