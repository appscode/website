# Configuring RBAC

To use Stash in a RBAC enabled cluster, [install Stash](/products/stash/0.6.3/setup/install) with RBAC options. This creates a ClusterRole named `stash-sidecar`.

Sidecar container added to workloads makes various calls to Kubernetes api. ServiceAccounts used with Deployment, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet and ReplicationController workloads are automatically bound to `stash-sidecar` ClusterRole by Stash operator. Users should manually add the following RoleBinding to service accounts used with StatefulSet workloads to authorize these api calls.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <statefulset-name>-stash-sidecar
  namespace: <statefulset-namespace>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: stash-sidecar
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: <statefulset-sa>
  namespace: <statefulset-namespace>
```
