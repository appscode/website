# Restore Backup
This tutorial will show you how to restore a Stash backup. At first, backup a kubernetes workload volume by following the steps [here](/products/stash/0.6.0/guides/backup).

To restore a backup, you need to create a `Recovery` CRD by specifying `Restic`, target workload and volume where backup will be restored.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f ./docs/examples/tutorial/recovery.yaml
recovery "stash-demo" created
```

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Recovery
metadata:
  name: stash-demo
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    kind: Deployment
    name: stash-demo
  backend:
    local:
      mountPath: /safe/data
      hostPath:
        path: /data/stash-test/restic-repo
    storageSecretName: stash-demo
  paths:
  - /source/data
  recoveredVolumes:
  - mountPath: /source/data
    hostPath:
      path: /data/stash-test/restic-restored
```

Here,

 - `spec.workload` specifies a target workload that was backed up using `Restic`. A single `Restic` backups all types of workloads that matches the label-selector, but you can only restore a specific workload using a `Recovery`.
    - For workload kind `Statefulset`, you need to specify pod [index](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#ordinal-index) using `spec.podOrdinal`.
    - For workload kind `Daemonset`, you need to specify node name using `spec.nodeName`.
 - `spec.backend` specifies the backend that was used in `Restic` to take backups.
 - `spec.paths` specifies the file-group paths that was backed up using `Restic`.
 - `spec.recoveredVolumes` indicates an array of volumes where snapshots will be recovered. Here, `mountPath` specifies where the volume will be mounted.
 Note that, `Recovery` recovers data in the same paths from where backup was taken (specified in `spec.paths`). So, volumes must be mounted on those paths or their parent paths.

Stash operator watches for `Recovery` objects using Kubernetes api. It collects required snapshot information from the specified `Restic` object. Then it creates a recovery job that performs the recovery guides. On completion, job and associated pods are deleted by stash operator. To verify recovery, we can check the `Recovery` status.

```yaml
$ kubectl get recovery stash-demo -o yaml

apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1

## Cleaning up

To cleanup the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```console
$ kubectl delete deployment stash-demo
$ kubectl delete secret stash-demo
$ kubectl delete restic stash-demo
$ kubectl delete recovery stash-demo
```

If you would like to uninstall Stash operator, please follow the steps [here](/products/stash/0.6.0/setup/uninstall).
