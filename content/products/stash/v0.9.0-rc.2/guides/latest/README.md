Guides show how to perform different operations with Stash. We have divided guides section into the following sub-sections:

- **Supported Backends :** This section describes how to configure different backend for Stash. It shows how to create `Storage Secret` and `Repository` object for different backends. Start learning to configure different backends from [here](/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.2/guides/latest/backends/overview).

- **Workloads :** Workloads section describes how to backup and restore data from/to inside various Kubernetes resources such as Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet etc. Get started with backup workloads data using Stash from [here](/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.2/guides/latest/workloads/overview).

- **Volumes :** Volumes section describes how to backup and restore stand-alone Kubernetes volumes using Stash. Learn how to backup Kubernetes volumes using Stash from [here](/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.2/guides/latest/volumes/overview).
