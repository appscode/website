# Stash Backends

Backend is where Stash stores backup snapshots. It can be a cloud storage like GCS bucket, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage etc. or a Kubernetes persistent volume like [HostPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath), [PersistentVolumeClaim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#persistentvolumeclaim), [NFS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#nfs) etc. Below diagram show how Stash sidecar container access and store backup data into a backend storage.

</p>

Stash sidecar container receive backend information from `spec.backend` field of [Restic](/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.1/concepts/crds/v1alpha1/restic) crd. It obtains necessary credentials to access the backend from the secret specified in `spec.backend.storageSecretName` field of Restic crd. Then on first backup schedule, Stash initialize a repository in the backend.

Below, a screenshot that show a repository created at AWS S3 bucket named `stash-qa` for a Deployment named `stash-demo`.

</p>

You will see all snapshots taken by Stash at `/snapshot` directory of this repository.

> Note: Stash keeps all backup data encrypted. So, snapshot files in the bucket will not contain any meaningful data until they are decrypted.

Stash creates a [Repository](/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.1/concepts/crds/repository) crd that represents original repository in backend in a Kubernetes native way. It holds information like number of backup snapshot taken, time when last backup was taken etc.

In order to use a backend, you have to configure `Restic` crd and create a `Secret` with necessary credentials.
